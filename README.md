# Imaging Access

## Actors, Roles, and Responsibilities

* SMART on FHIR EHR
  * Authorization Endpoint
    * Provide SMART authorization services
  * Token Introspection Endpoint
    * Support SMART on FHIR token introspection
  * Clinical FHIR Server (EHR)
    * Primary clinical information store, including Patient records, etc.
* (New!) SMART on FHIR Imaging
  * ImagingStudy FHIR Endpoint
    * FHIR store either containing ImagingStudy records or having the ability to fetch / generate them
    * Can be hosted within the EHR's FHIR endpoint or separately
  * DICOM WADO Endpoint(s)
    * Imaging data store supporting (at a minimum) WADO access to fetch a study by UID
* (New!) Imaging Client Application

Note that some of actors are separated by responsibility for clarity, but this project makes no assumptions about implementation.  For example, FHIR Imaging records may be stored in the Clinical FHIR Server, the DICOM server endpoint may be a proxy that implements the necessary WADO interface, etc..

## Assumptions and Pre-conditions

* EHR supports SMART on FHIR authorization
* EHR supports SMART on FHIR token introspection
* App knows the EHR's imaging endpoint either through:
  * out-of-band config, or
  * EHR's `.well-known/smart-configuration` includes an `smart-imaging-access` URL
* EHR authorization screen includes support for `patient/*.read` (or `patient/ImagingStudy.read`)
* User agrees to share imaging data with App, during the SMART App "Standalone Launch" flow

For background on imaging infrastructure and identifiers, see [./infrastructure-and-identifiers-primer.md](./infrastructure-and-identifiers-primer.md).

## Scaling Considerations

* Passing every "Get Studies for Patient" query through to an underlying PACS might overload these systems. The Imaging FHIR endpoint can avoid this with approaches like:
  * Caching FHIR ImagingStudy Resources (e.g., with some heuristic for invalidation)
  * Establishing change feeds from the underlying PACS to improve invalidation accuracy
  
## Workflow

* Discovery: App learns Imaging FHIR endpoint associated with EHR Clinical FHIR endpoint
* App authorized via SMART on FHIR
* Optional: App queries EHR clinical FHIR server for data
* App queries imaging FHIR server for `ImagingStudy` resource
* App following links from ImagingStudy to fetch DICOM data

Notes:
* Steps `1` through `6` in the diagram represent basic functionality in the SMART App Launch workflow.
* Steps `7` and `8` represent basic FHIR functionality (getting patient information), which should be available in any FHIR implementation.
* Steps `9` and `10` use standard FHIR functionality around the [ImagingStudy](http://hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy.html) resource.
* In Step `11`, the client is requesting DICOM data via WADO, using the token received during SMART App Launch.
* In Steps `12` and `13`, the DICOM server is performing token introspection to validate the patient context against the request.
* In Step `14`, DICOM data is returned to the client.

## API Calls

### Discovery of Imaging FHIR Endpoints

EHRs supporting in-band discovery **SHALL** advertise their Imaging FHIR Endpoints by including `"smart-imaging-access"` in the appropriate locations(s) of their `.well-known/smart-configuration`:

* top-level `capabilities` if this FHIR endpoint directly supports Imaging Access
* nested `associated_endpoints[].capabilities` if associated FHIR endpoints support Imaging Access

#### Example discovery document

Consider a FHIR server with base URL `https://ehr.example.org/fhir`, whose Imaging FHIR Endpoint is hosted at `https://imaging.example.org/fhir`.

The discovery document at `https://ehr.example.org/fhir/.well-known/smart-configuration` would include:

```js
{
  "capabilities": [
    // <other capabilities snipped>
  ],
  "associated_endpoints": [
    {
      "url": "https://imaging.example.org/fhir",
      "capabilities": ["smart-imaging-access"]
    }
  ]
  // <other properties snipped>
}
```

### App obtains an access token 

App redirects to `/authorize` and receives an authorization code. Then App calls `POST /token` to obtain:

```
   {
     "expires_in": 3600,
     "access_token": "access-token-value-unguessable",
     "refresh_token": "refresh-token-value-unguessable-and-long-lasting",
     "patient": "123" # FHIR Patient ID ==> https://ehr.example.org/Patient/123
   }
```

Now app has an access token that it can use for clinical + imaging APIs

### App requests imaging studies for patient

(Newlines added for clarity only.)

```
GET https://imaging-api.example.org/ImagingStudy?
  patient=123&
  _include=ImagingStudy:endpoint&
  _lastUpdated=gt2023-04-17T04:00:00

Authorization: Bearer access-token-value-unguessable
```

The Imaging FHIR server SHALL support returning Endpoints for each `ImagingStudy` (whether contained or external), enabling the query parameter `_include=ImagingStudy:endpoint`.

The Imaging FHIR server SHALL support the following search parameters combinations:

* `patient=123` specifying a patient ID
* `patient=123&_lastUpdated=gt2023-01-30` specifying a patient ID and a "last-updated after" timestamp
* `patient=123&identifier=urn:oid:1.2.3` specifying a patient ID and a DICOM Study Instance UID (`urn:oid:...`)

If the Imaging FHIR server is distinct from the Clinical FHIR server, it needs to make an access control decision informed by the EHR. One option is to use the EHR's Token Introspection API:

```
POST https://introspection.internal.example.org/introspect
token=access-token-value-unguessable
```

The Imaging FHIR server makes sure that 
* the Patient ID from `ImagingStudy?patient={}` matches the patient ID value returned in the introspection response
* the access token is `active`
* the access token includes `patient/ImagingStudy.read`, `patient/*.read`, or other scopes appropriate for the request

The Imaging FHIR server MAY request additional information as needed from the EHR (e.g., leveraging Backend Services API access to `GET https://ehr.example.org/Patient/123`.) This can help by providing a list of patient Identifiers or other details that the Imaging FHIR server may need to cross-map with its own data.

### Imaging FHIR server responds with data or a "wait up!" status

If the Imaging FHIR server needs to fetch data from sources that will take some time (e.g., issuing a DICOM C-FIND query under the hood), it MAY respond with a `503` status and a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds the app should wait before re-trying its query.

If Imaging data is already available (e.g., URLs point to the DICOM server, data has already been cached, etc.), it responds with a FHIR Bundle of ImagingStudy resources, filtering by `Meta.lastUpdated` or `ImagingStudy.started` if client has supplied one of these search parameters.

Each `ImagingStudy` in the Bundle SHALL populate the following elements:

* `resourceType`
* `id`
* `identifier` with `system` of `urn:dicom:uid` and `value` of `urn:oid:...`
* `status`
* `patient`
* `modality`
* `endpoint`
* `numberOfSeries`
* `numberOfInstances`


Each `ImagingStudy` in the Bundle SHOULD populate the following elements:

* `series`
  * `uid`
  * `number`
  * `modality`
  * `numberOfInstances`
  * `instance`
    * `uid`
    * `number`
    * `sopClass`


Here is an example `ImagingStudy` resource:

```json
  {
    "resourceType": "ImagingStudy",
    "id": "123",
    "identifier":{
        "system":"urn:dicom:uid",
	"value":"urn:oid:1.2.3"
    },
    "status": "available",
    "patient": {"reference": "https://ehr.example.org/Patient/123"},
    "started": "2023-02-24T14:02:49Z",
    "modality": [{
      "coding" : [{
        "system" : "http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCM",
        "code" : "CT"
      }]
    }],
    "endpoint": {"reference": "#e"} // May be "contained" or external
    "contained": [{
      "resourceType": "Endpoint",
      "id": "e",
      "address": "https://example.org/path/to/wado-endpoint",
      "connectionType": {
        "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/endpoint-connection-type",
        "code": "dicom-wado-rs"
      },
      "extension": [{
        "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/StructureDefinition/requires-access-token",
        "valueBoolean": true
      }]
    }]
  }
```

Whether "contained" or external, the `Endpoint` SHALL include:

* `address` a WADO base URL from which queries about the study can be made
* `connectionType` indicating DICOM Web WADO-RS with
```json
{
  "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/endpoint-connection-type",
  "code": "dicom-wado-rs",
}
```

* `extension` to indicate that the WADO endpoint works with the SMART Imaging API, using the same access tokens as this ImagingStudy endpoint. (See [this definition](https://hl7.org/fhir/async-bulk.html#:~:text=Indicates%20whether%20downloading%20the%20generated%20files%20requires%20the%20same%20authorization%20mechanism).)
```json
{
  "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/StructureDefinition/requires-access-token",
  "valueBoolean": true
}
```

### App requests instance data from wado-rs

The app can construct a series of requests from the $wado-rs URL by appending `/studies/<Example Study UID>`:

```
   GET https://imaging-api.example.org/Patient/123/$wado-rs/studies/example-study-uid
   Accept: multipart/related; type=application/dicom; transfer-syntax=*
   Authorization: Bearer access-token-value-unguessable
```

At a minimum the server **SHALL** support retrieving a full study when the client requests 

    multipart/related; type=application/dicom; transfer-syntax=*
    
This minimum subset is designed to ensure that even a static server can participate in hosting images. However, additional app features become possible with more capable servers. Servers SHOULD support additional WADO-RS functionality:

* series-level retrieval
* instance-level retrieval
* rendering / preview / thumbnail generation
* re-encoding based on negotiated transfer-syntax

### WADO endpoint responds with instance data

As above, the server validates the access token via the Token Introspection API, ensuring that the token:
* is active
* matches the patient ID for the requested study
* includes scopes for `patient/ImagingStudy.read` or `patient/*.read` access

As above, if the server needs to fetch data from sources that will take some time (e.g., issuing a DICOM C-MOVE query under the hood), it MAY respond with a `503` status and a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds the app should wait before re-trying its query.

If response data are available directly, the server returns

 ```
200
 Content-type: multipart/related; type=application/dicom
 [[DICOM DATA BINARY PAYLOAD]]
```
